### Color Palette Extraction

The dashboard automatically extracts the dominant colors from your currently playing album artwork and uses them to create a beautiful gradient background that matches your music.

### Real-time Updates

Your playback state is synchronized in real-time, including:

- Current track information
- Playback progress
- Next track in queue
- Recently played history

### Playback Controls

Full control over your Spotify playback right from the dashboard:
